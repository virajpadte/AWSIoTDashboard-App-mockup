# AWSIoTDashboard-App-mockup
Designing a mockup for AWS IoT mockup. The app design must be suitable to design text data and graph data.

The app design will be created using sketchapp and UI mockup will be done using invision.



Update 04/05/2017: I have completed doing a mockup for this app using Invision.

PS: Since I will also be implementing the final application in swift3 I will be hosting a code repository in another public repository.
